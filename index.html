<i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-3x"></i><span style ="font-family:'Quicksand'">   Shreya joined my team as junior developer, she demonstrated great attitude and team spirit. She was inquisitive to learn and contribute, hence she picked up Big Data technologies in no time and with little guidance was productive. She showed excellent skills in Data Analytics and contributed in developing Dashboards on ZoomData, also she worked on various projects involving Hive and Apache NiFi for COE Analytics @ Jio. I wish her all luck for future endeavours.</span><!</a>

<br><i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-3x"></i><span style="font-family:'Quicksand'"> Can we really trust younger developers with that much responsibility? I remember asking. Shreya's work required moving between Individual Contributor and reviewer role. Switching between distant topics, figuring out the context and learning for it. Keeping up with technologies. Her days were mostly high-effort times with little lull period.
Reviewer role doesnâ€™t make one very popular, but she tried to be kind while declining and kept goodwill by keeping others informed of statuses affecting them, picked a phone ,walked down the floor than just emailing. At times, she was on her own between "ship it soon!" and "ship it when itâ€™s done!" folks.
If something was on me, reminded n corrected me in a tactful manner. Always kept her work organized. Could pull report just like that.
Shreya demonstrated excellent work ethics. I remember she had habit of always asking before leaving making sure we reviewed stuff in time for any potential release the next morning. She was consistently pleasant and tackled her assignments with great dedication and a smile.
In the end, Without her team building rituals, attention to details, willingness to learn more in her own time, our team would not have been that effective.
I am sure she has got more successes coming her way.</span></p>
