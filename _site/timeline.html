          <h3>Assisted with a Project</h3>
          <p>I helped my friend with a project that involved more to do with extracting audio out of the video and converting it into text, later getting a summarized part of the text using NLTK and then reconverting the text back to audio. On the other side extracting the frames out of the video and deleting the repetitive frames. For longer videos the frequency of frames had to be changed so as to get minimum images with entire content. </p>

Produced Jasper reports later utilized in Java application to generate dynamic content for Telecom Regulation of India project which improved the delivery of content by 30%.Also, I built data source for Jio Payments Bank project and constructed dashboards to derive useful information using Zoomdata - a tool specifically used for Big Data.  </p>
